City shrouded in darkness, covered in crackling aureoles of electricity. What has happened is the [Air Protocol](/p/39af5dfd7ca34fd2ad511129944e10c9) is down and so there are huge releases of dark energy.

Extreme high energy arcs.

This releases the [devils](/p/a22030bec1ff40e587d2146fb95be185), which overrun the streets.

From this point everything is on reserve emergency power. [Firefly](/p/fa265d0089834a398c8b7a51bd6d8cb3) helps.

[Starbusses](/p/e91ff4dce0f8469b803a6d314663f59c) no longer have contingencies outside of them and they are bound to sub light speed or something. Maybe thatâ€™s too breaking.

The [Glass Dogs](/p/bfaa1e1d9187463ba1186d4010048e93) go mad and start attacking everything. You have to escape across the rooftops, the fighting below is too intense. It's a four way battle between the glass dogs, the devils, the messengers, and the warfighters. However, it may just be three way if the messengers and warfighters remain against you.

Depending on which [Key](/p/b416261f502a4586ad3f4dc1353346e7) you took, the [Messengers](/p/ad88bd18603b455db621ae9f9243c7e4) or the [Warfighters ](/p/64a95ac03b7546249ebe255b2b2fd8a6) will fight for you. But it's not enough. Either one advises you to escape from the rooftops. The keychain around your neck. Even if you take neither key, it's the only way through. Escaping otherwise is just too hard.

Last of all, this frees [the Weatherman](/p/626c245aa9f84338bbd35a3874186b8a). It weakens him in one sense, and strengthens him in another. Power is sort of shut off to the whole city, but he finally has control of the weather.

So instead of the flat grey sky which is usually there, he calls down lightning storms, giant torrents. And so everything is in this total chaos.
