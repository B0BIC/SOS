Appears in [dreams](/p/c6ada77226e24eab9558973d33216c8c).

In the dream, he boards the [Starbus](/p/e91ff4dce0f8469b803a6d314663f59c) you’re on.

He just looks at you. A look of silent inscrutable love.

In the same way that God makes His home in a soul, the player lives in the shadow…

ILoveYou

Never met, only spoken about.
This game takes place a long time after our world. Things have changed but our savior is still the same.

The creator has only ever spoken once. In all the endless ages, he only had one thing to say, one word: I love you.
That was his last message.
ILOVEYOU
His name is “I love you.”

You think you did this all yourself? He was with you. Always.
