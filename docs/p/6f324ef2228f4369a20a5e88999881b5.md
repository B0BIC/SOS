Heart (status system)

The status of your heart. Killing innocents makes it burn with evil (black fire), doing good makes it burn with goodness (white fire). The better you are, the more the Devils will rage at you, the higher their spawn rate.

If you are evil they will leave you alone. If you are evil enough, even the [Devils](/p/a22030bec1ff40e587d2146fb95be185) will abandon youâ€¦ you will be confronted by the whispering [Witnesses](/p/71f7bbe694b74dde9a39c628cfc1e9ff) (who serve as good cover, actually)

***

Each creature has a **heart**. I don't know how this could pay off in gameplay.
