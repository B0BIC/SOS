Devils shackled by Warfighter techs and pressed into combat. Because this technology is arcane and difficult (and the capture and control process so difficult), these are rather rare enemies. [Prison Planet](/p/fde64cac01824d63a685fa2cd4695b38) facility only has one of them, which they use to punish particularly rebellious prisoners (maybe, haven't decided yet). Wizards are more adept at this. Perhaps one of the [Princes of the Empire](/p/0b4fce6215444ac7ace59680400ea00d) is adept at managing burden devils.

They are chained around and clearly bioengineered to be obedient to technological inputs. [Wizards](/p/e3ff55f45f0143ebac643c1cc37813a3) do a slightly better job with their [Trained Devils](/p/f46513ec051945a2b5cc36154bef3656), but the burdens are more violent, and stronger.

Yet they are still relatively weak in comparison to normal [Devils](/p/a22030bec1ff40e587d2146fb95be185) or even [Guardian Devils](/p/4f79eabdd870462cbc159e5477f56726).
