Your Star
Type: natural feature

One of the [Wandering Stars](/p/f4a90264fddc4ff6af8749329d31eb50).

Descends from the sky in your hour of need.

See in a star guide that it’s the **star of sunset**.

Shoot it and it gets offended but comes down and says hello.

If you attack and kill her, all her sister Stars descend to fight you in concert.

They’re all different sizes and colors and they all have shining swords.
