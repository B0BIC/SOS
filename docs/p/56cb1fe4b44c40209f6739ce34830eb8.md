Depopulation Team

A special paramilitary security force used to clear out [echoes and shadows](/p/da622103663d4fad8372a8769414cc25) in the outlands of [The Empire](:/d665997d0f0c482c89a644d4544217a2).

Electric torches (flashlights).

Have flamethrowers to destroy structures once they’re done with them.

As Sunset is being led away, you can turn around and see them burning up your building with flamethrowers.

Later repurposed to fight the [Devils](/p/a22030bec1ff40e587d2146fb95be185).

Wear flame resistant cloaks.

Also carry "[Readers](/p/ee8732f115d54add941270ffbf33cd9a) ," devices which can get a signature of an echo/shadow.

Echo signatures. If the signature is too weak they leave it alone to fade into nothingness on its own and burn everything up.

[Lucy](/p/dc866b99f5794c99874dbaae8479870f) has something similar.

***

Depopulation teams pick up shadows and echoes under a legal pretense. All political power is concentrated in the master’s person. The known universe is his personal property.

Echoes and shadows are legal entities with no rights. They are the private property of the master.

“Pursuant to order CR5577-B, you are subject to detainment.”

Maybe you hear them poking around outside, tracing a reading.

The eerie tone of the instrument. Like a Geiger counter or metal detector.

Chief is [Peace Officer One](/p/1f69094026e64289883eacfd026e270d)
