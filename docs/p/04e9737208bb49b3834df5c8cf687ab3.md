An area on [Prison Planet](/p/fde64cac01824d63a685fa2cd4695b38) where the [Depopulation Team](/p/56cb1fe4b44c40209f6739ce34830eb8) warfighters put all the artifacts the [ghosts](/p/da622103663d4fad8372a8769414cc25) had in their personal possession or anything interesting they may have found on the premises when they were captured.

This is where [Firefly](/p/fa265d0089834a398c8b7a51bd6d8cb3) is being held. He actually unlocks the door to the area for you.

There are many lost and inexplicable things here...

But I have to think of good examples.
