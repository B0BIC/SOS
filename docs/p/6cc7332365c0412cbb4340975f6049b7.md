# Scene:

[Lucy](/p/dc866b99f5794c99874dbaae8479870f)'s second or so song after you escape the [Prison](/p/fde64cac01824d63a685fa2cd4695b38) … causes the earth to shake… hundreds of [Lost Messengers](/p/893f5b7d04994a3e8f0263a7b0ba011f) emerge from the earth, from burial or half burial. It’s enough to wake the dead, I guess.

It’s terrifying (they sweep over with deafening sound, like fighter jets), but they end up fighting one another. Playing your cards right, you should be able to escape.
