There must be a trace of reality within the dream.

I mean there must be vestiges of the real. That’s how it works in real life. Every so often there are things which are pleasing because they are realistic. They represent how things would really happen. I think of the quick cut of the waiting technicians in the first episode of Evangelion. It grounds the experience, which would otherwise be too dreamlike.

Actually, “too dreamlike” is not the right way to put it. A key feature of dreams is that they mix the improbable and the fantastic with various fragments of banal quotidian reality.

Just a brief reminder that this world is not a fantasy, then. That’s another way to put it. A fantasy is a flight from the real world. A dream is something else entirely.

I mean, not all dreams are the same. But certain dreams are profound continuations or revelations of waking life. That is what a good story should be. It should be as dreamlike as possible.

Well, then again, dreams *are* famously irrational.

Ok. I made this note to say that there should be little moments like the technician cut in SOS. Also, it was watching death note which made me think of this, though it’s hard to come up with an example.

Maybe when the US president gives his rationale for cooperating with Kira. It all sounds very realistic.
