Constant clicking crackling noise of their joints rubbing together. Different from how the [Witnesses](/p/71f7bbe694b74dde9a39c628cfc1e9ff) tick in time.

One serpent whispers: “Not yet time, not yet time, not yet time…”

The other whispers: "Not yet mine, not yet mine, not yet mine..."

The two are entwined in a figure eight.

They are megabossess of [The Deep](/p/ac458f6ea8e2410e9eddcdc79d5a90f7).
