A: What is this story about?

B: It’s about going [home](/p/a20eec20a73b4baf90f96bd591b6d7ee). Everybody wants to go home.

A: Who wants to go home?

B: Everybody. [Lucy](/p/dc866b99f5794c99874dbaae8479870f). [The Lion](/p/2001b9b679ed4d8abbd8cfb46998773c). [Sunset](/p/e86dde5ef894493cb5e1f93855b62c83).

Maybe it’s about heaven… sort of. Some kind of promised land. Wanting things to be how they were. I guess in so many words, that is just “home.” Here is the story. You meet Lucy. She wants to go home. You need each other to escape, because she brings some kind of light… because of [Firefly](/p/fa265d0089834a398c8b7a51bd6d8cb3). She is a battery to a universal reconstructor, the theodolite. The antagonist keeps the creatures in prison… waiting until he can see them clearly. He is waiting to remember.

A: what, remembering?

B: yes, by remembering.. this isn’t clear.

In the end he destroys it. Look to one another. Look to the creator.

A: So, what were you saying? It's about going home?

B: Yes. More than that, it's about how you can't.

A: "You can't go home again," huh?

B: Yes.

A: Tell me the story.

B: From the perspective of the main character, or from an objective view?

A: From an objective view.

B: Alright.
