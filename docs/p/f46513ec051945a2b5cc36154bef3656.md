Trained to do tricks by the [Wizards](/p/e3ff55f45f0143ebac643c1cc37813a3). Subdued as a sort of dangerous pet...

They look like a regular [devils](/p/a22030bec1ff40e587d2146fb95be185) but they are blue and star-spangled.

They do backflips, they breathe fire on command. And if you ever fight the wizards, they'll sic them on you.
