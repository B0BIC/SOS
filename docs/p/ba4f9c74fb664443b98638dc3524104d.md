Damage system

No visible damage meters.

Damage is gauged by enemy appearance. Especially damaged limbs/joints begin to burn and flicker with Laser Fire (applies to [Messengers](/p/ad88bd18603b455db621ae9f9243c7e4) and boss enemies, such as the [Princes of the Empire](/p/0b4fce6215444ac7ace59680400ea00d)).

You can see the clothing under the armor plates/rotting cybernetic components underneath destroyed armor when fighting [Warfighters](/p/64a95ac03b7546249ebe255b2b2fd8a6). Certain warfighters have stainless steel under their armor. This is a whole nother layer.

Maybe enemies pivot/rotate depending on what parts of their armor youâ€™ve damaged (hide the damage parts from you). Maybe they carry kits which they can use to slap new armor plates on. Salvage them from other dead enemies.

Or there could be a certain kind of Warfighter whose job is to repair the others. [Salvage Team](/p/9dc015ab7b754160a21e447e30a80c20) (yellow).

Different colors appear when armor breaks.
