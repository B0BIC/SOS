The only other book in [the library](/p/2027d68ffecb47449da8062236a6f303) which has any text in it. You find it jammed in a vent. [Lucy](/p/dc866b99f5794c99874dbaae8479870f) is desperate to find any surviving book. You help her out of pity.

“There must be something here. There has to be. We came all this way. There has to be something. I don’t want to be all alone in the cold. I don’t want to be all alone. Help me with this, will you?”

And so on. Now you can [sleep](/p/c6ada77226e24eab9558973d33216c8c) again. Or sometime earlier.

Cover says:

"
**THE**
**END**
"

in gold embossed font on leather backing. Simple courier.

It is impossible to tell if Lucy is consoled.

The Surveyor references this as the key to the power to change the world.

Perhaps the eye is somehow relevant to [Sunset](/p/e86dde5ef894493cb5e1f93855b62c83). That could be his symbol…

Somehow lion learns that the surveyor is hidden in the end. But the end is that book.

He doesn’t steal Lucy until after the library.
