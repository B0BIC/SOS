Dialogue System

# Game marks all "played" dialogue and never plays it again.

*The player should never hear the same dialogue twice. Silence is preferable to repetition.*

If they want, the player can select a setting that resets all dialogue (maybe…)

Words should have weight. They should mean something. I'm sick of them not meaning anything…
