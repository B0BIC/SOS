Many ruins should be in such an advanced state of decay that their original purpose is difficult if not impossible to determine.

Should also be environments on the outer worlds or even in the Main city that are like dusk. The beginning of night when the dim glow of the sun fades out of the sky. A parking lot with mute street lamps. Architecture which gestures at something but never quite arrives. “Liminal spaces”

The city functions as if it were full of people.

This is most eerie when it comes to the train systems. Travel schedules constantly updating, but everything is completely deserted. Doors open and close, public notices are displayed and update, though they have really old timers (large numbers which extend off the screen).

No advertising (rule broken by the guide, but the screens are blank otherwise. She splices together images to show you stuff).

The interlocking wheels of karma and eternity… exhaustion…

“Sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.”
