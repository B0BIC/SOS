Gameplay: throw yourself in ball form, hit an enemy for huge damage then double fire rate as you fall to the ground (slow motion)

Weird move where screen splits and you can line up shots (front and back shooting simultaneously). When you line up shots, it does double damage.

Wandering star arena in deep space. Maybe jumping from star to star as you also fight the stars? Some kind of sword that leaves mini explosions in its wake have to keep moving?
