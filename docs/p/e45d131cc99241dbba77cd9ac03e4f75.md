Thematic Summary

[Story Roadmap](/p/64c71b1bfb2a4717a53593ce05b258f8) is good

New idea for the framework of the story; much more melancholy:

3 figures:

The [Sunset](/p/e86dde5ef894493cb5e1f93855b62c83), a mute cipher imprisoned in the dying ruins of an ancient civilization—

A [Lucy](/p/dc866b99f5794c99874dbaae8479870f), driven to the hero by an impulse of kindness—

An [implacable antagonist](/p/2001b9b679ed4d8abbd8cfb46998773c), who doesn’t even fully understand himself…

And all the armies of earth and heaven.

***

A New Lord of the Rings, for future pagans, instead of past ones

[As things come apart and fade…](/p/c22fc76d04234ba699c3a52fa67f7520)

I feel galled by the greatness of the East. I was watching an Isekai and it struck me that, while Japan makes good on certain promises, these promises all had their origin in the west. The whole modern fantasy genre came from Tolkien. It would be wonderful if I could do something similar. 
But to have that influence, you have to touch a person's heart.

Your story has to be better than every other. But I won't make any progress if I think of things in such prideful terms.

Better to really let loose and hope the spirit which inspires me is voluble, and that I am a keen instrument for even the least of its intentions.

I *miss* that Starbucks in the Mill Valley Rocco's shopping center.

Gameplay is in the service of the story. It all serves the story.

**It is hard sci-fi pretending to be fantasy.**
