Firecracker/Sparky

One of the primal people. Things have gotten so dark and dull since he left that his pure light presence is constantly fizzling and sparkling.

He doesn't understand why he's there; he doesn't understand anything. Total Naïf. Doesn't even realize he's sparkling.

Someone who was left behind, by pure chance…

Not sure I want to leave him in. Idk where he fits.
