[Peace Team](/p/3cb671899d6e4f15a8d2fc4076e56356)

[Depopulation Team](/p/56cb1fe4b44c40209f6739ce34830eb8)

Flight Team (wings on their armor, shoot rockets),

[Mercury Team](/p/16a088573fb34c10b8aec5bedd6b442b) (no good weapons, just pistols and light armor, but each step carries them hundreds of feet forwards),

Cherubim (white-armored Warfighters who repair the messengers  and have mini-laser weapons),

[Rangers / Sniper Team](/p/77860d6ebf5241c68d6f433d7ea7d9b2) (Each Sniper comes with a spotter, equipped with an assault rifle, and a sniper, who only has his sniper and a sidearm. There are medium, long, and super-long-range snipers)… “Scout team?”

[Lion Guard](/p/f7dd897f255d410fb2d160b768b8656b)

[Liquid Team](/p/e552fd33a5ae462494623dd4a9c2d73a) (blend in to the environments, not with tech camo but natural stuff, have much better aim and are much harder, especially the commanders)

[Vapor Team](/p/e552fd33a5ae462494623dd4a9c2d73a) (invisible soldiers, try to sneak up for a knife attack). You only know it’s them by seeing them (very hard), or by hearing the distinctive sound of their decloak.
