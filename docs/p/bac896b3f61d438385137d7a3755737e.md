Gameplay Ethos

Increasingly difficult, always tough, but never BS.

Punishingly difficult. Different difficulty levels unlock deeper dialogue, new items and equipment.

Should play like DooM 2/Blood/Duke Nukem 3d/Ion Maidenâ€¦

No expiring items!!! ([Object Permanence \[Tech\]](/p/8e4453da33024fff9ae92105ae14e534))

Gameplay should become increasingly **complex**, but not increasingly difficult.

Mega-pixel First Person shooter with scant RPG elements (hyper-linear, however).

Hyper-linear, but you can get special items and gameplay boosts by exploring. Also promotes multiple replays.

Glove that can pick up entire blocks worth of rubble and hurl them at enemies

Jump-boot battle across the rooftops of a giant ruined city, gradually getting more and more destroyed.

Sparse UI.
