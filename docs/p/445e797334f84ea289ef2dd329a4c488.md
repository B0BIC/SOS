# Fear Bar System/combo system

Fear bar, raises in enemies the better you’re doing (acts like a combo meter) until they all flee.

Fear bar isn’t shown to the player, has to be observed from how they’re trembling, their voice lines… remember how in spec ops the line the main character got bloody and his callouts started getting ragged and terror-filled. Well it should be like that.

It goes down faster the more enemies there are… and different types of enemies have different amounts of courage.

There are literally “fearless” enemies.
