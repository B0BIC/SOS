Who are literally jpg compression artifacts. Whisper things to you over the intercoms. Emergently evolved and kept in the system for good luck. They are a source of [secrets](/p/8745a29a9b92485c8e2a965fd6875a37)

Maybe the tutorial happens through artifacts?

Again, worried these are too much like [Witnesses](/p/71f7bbe694b74dde9a39c628cfc1e9ff). The difference perhaps is that witnesses are super-tangible, but obscure, whereas Artifacts are holographic. They're actually opposites.
