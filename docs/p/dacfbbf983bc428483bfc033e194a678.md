Theodolite. A universal reconstructor.

Lucy is the energy source which activates it.

The Theodolite was destroyed long ago. The surveyor regretted that he had created it, or he came to realize that he didn't need it.

"I found another way to achieve my heart's desire. The answer is hidden in the end."

"There is another way for creatures to fulfill their hearts' desires. **The thing that you are seeking is hidden in the end.**"

Not the place, but the book.

**Love** is the end. See [The End](/p/96f5dcec0cba496fafc1e25040a57b07) in [The Library](/p/2027d68ffecb47449da8062236a6f303).

The answer is hidden in the end?
