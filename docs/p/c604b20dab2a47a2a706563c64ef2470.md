# Deep Space (Ancient) Angels

While Sunset is journeying into deep space, he encounters a miracle of nature.

The 8 cornerstones of the stars. Guardians of the abyss.

Their armor is black, they are much larger (because they came from a period of higher technological advancement), and they are covered with eyes.

The most ancient messengers, sent out by [the Surveyor](/p/c7964e9075b3441eb4bd789fd283aa6a) to explore the furthest limits of the universe.

But there is an end to [the abyss](/p/ac458f6ea8e2410e9eddcdc79d5a90f7)

Maybe this is where the Surveyor found [Firefly](/p/fa265d0089834a398c8b7a51bd6d8cb3).

The Surveyor gave him to Lucy.

They fight [Wandering Stars](/p/f4a90264fddc4ff6af8749329d31eb50), [Guardian Devils](/p/4f79eabdd870462cbc159e5477f56726), and [Serpents of the Deep](/p/f118167e8a4f4bf58bfd839673c964c8). All of which begin to appear as you reach the limits of the universe.
