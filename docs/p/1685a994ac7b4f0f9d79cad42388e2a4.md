Permanence and Loss

Once [Lucy](/p/dc866b99f5794c99874dbaae8479870f) dies, she is gone from all subsequent playthroughs (maybe until the next playthrough). This is tied to the account you used to buy the game, to ensure that it’s permanent (unless you want to buy the game again).

Once Lucy dies, the [music](/p/4f10d741d1b949dda6606a9af27b0225) stops.

For the playthrough that she died in, her ragdoll is chained to the player’s feet (if killed in the first encounter). This is the darkest run. If you play this run, there are no [Devils](/p/a22030bec1ff40e587d2146fb95be185) in the game. Indeed, maybe you have to fight [Wandering Stars](/p/f4a90264fddc4ff6af8749329d31eb50) …

This is also connected to [Music](/p/4f10d741d1b949dda6606a9af27b0225). Once Lucy dies, she can’t sing any more songs for you.

The [Lion](/p/2001b9b679ed4d8abbd8cfb46998773c) can also die. Afterwards, replaced by a shadow which decreases by 5% brightness every time you beat a playthrough.

You only ever hear a line of dialogue once.

Also ties in to [Object Permanence \[Tech\]](/p/8e4453da33024fff9ae92105ae14e534).

Maybe Lucy cannot be killed, but if you willfully attack her, she shuts down.
