Gameplay frame (soul)

Protagonist is animated by the player in the same way that all things have form and life through God, & cannot love or so much as move without him.

Protagonist doesnâ€™t want to move, player has to mash buttons and at some point he accepts and moves. This ties in to his echo/shadow nature.
