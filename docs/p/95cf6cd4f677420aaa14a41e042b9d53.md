In this scene, you are chained again together with Lucy, forced to fight against [Cain](/p/ac3b4a20469c41c7b61802b2cb877eb1).  [Lucy](/p/dc866b99f5794c99874dbaae8479870f) somehow defeats it with an energy burst which you prompt from her, but this frightens her, the violence. She can't control her innate energy... she emerges from the darkness, sobbing...

At a crucial point of the game, Lucy is trapped in a tight space with [Cain](/p/ac3b4a20469c41c7b61802b2cb877eb1). The player is frightened by this, cause he thinks Cain is going to tear her apart. But you can’t see anything, then she emerges, sobbing, soaked with blood, a knife in her hands. Inconsolable. “Oh, Sunset, I don’t know what happened, I—” Grimace of intense pain. Sound of intense self-revulsion.

“I never wanted to hurt anyone. Even something like him was once..."

"..."

"I remember. Do you understand?"
