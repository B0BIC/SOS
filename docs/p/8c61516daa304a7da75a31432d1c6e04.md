Unspecified place where [Witnesses](/p/71f7bbe694b74dde9a39c628cfc1e9ff) take bodies. They have to rise the starbus to get there. Maybe it’s a grave planet. 

It is not the same as the [Prison Planet.](/p/fde64cac01824d63a685fa2cd4695b38) The messengers there are relics from something even more ancient than the establishment of the graveyard.

There is a pair of witnesses, [Charon and Snowball.](/p/e297d82e5afd4b319a71ebe05308aeeb)

You may see them on the [starbus](/p/e91ff4dce0f8469b803a6d314663f59c).

They are not present at the graveyard the first time you visit. Or not in the section you are at. You are traveling through the messenger section.
