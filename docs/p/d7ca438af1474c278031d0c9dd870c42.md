Enemy: Citizens

Citizens are creatures from the old world which have lost their way. Their eyes glow with an eerie blue light, they’re semi-transparent, and they’re usually dressed in dusty business clothes.

[They speak the ancient dead language.](/p/df05717708904fa48356e4c18e538466)

A citizen has a super-tangible body but shadow [heart](/p/6f324ef2228f4369a20a5e88999881b5), whereas a [shadow/echo/ghost](/p/da622103663d4fad8372a8769414cc25) has a shadow body, but a living soul. They all carry on as if nothing was wrong… this is uncanny, as there are relatively few of them.

They just don’t get that the disaster has happened. They won’t admit it if you confront them about it (as Lucy might).

[Things fall apart in different ways.](/p/c22fc76d04234ba699c3a52fa67f7520)

They’re usually [afraid](/p/445e797334f84ea289ef2dd329a4c488) of shadows/echoes because they think they’re ghosts.
