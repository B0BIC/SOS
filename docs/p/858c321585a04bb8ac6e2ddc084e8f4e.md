This is a story about going home, and letting go. Lucy breaks out because she wants to go home. But she finds that it has been destroyed. Lion wants to go home.

***

Isn’t the story about letting go? Yes, it is. You have to let go, in order to move on, in order to move forward. This world is so nostalgic that there is nothing new in it. The only beings are fading shadows. It has become incapable of producing anything new.

[The End](/p/96f5dcec0cba496fafc1e25040a57b07) means the goal. But it is also the last part.

The ultimate goal. What is that? Simply love. The love formed or found between [Lucy](/p/dc866b99f5794c99874dbaae8479870f) and [Sunset](/p/e86dde5ef894493cb5e1f93855b62c83). That makes it worthwhile to remain.

Because otherwise, it would be worth it to go home. Remember that Lucy is also tempted to abandon them all and go home herself, all alone…

She is full of so much misery. That is a world of light.
