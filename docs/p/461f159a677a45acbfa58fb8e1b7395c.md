song of Sophia ideas

Gameplay: throw yourself in ball form, hit an enemy for huge damage then double fire rate as you fall to the ground (slow motion)

Weird move where screen splits and you can line up shots (front and back shooting simultaneously). When you line up shots, each one does double damage.

Wandering star arena in deep space. Maybe jumping from star to star as you also fight the stars? Some kind of sword that leaves mini explosions in its wake have to keep moving? <- cool idea

Sophia singing causes stars to light up, but you don’t notice this unless you’re paying attention. *She’s an energy generator.*
