Before it was our life, it was a song.

It was on his first day in prison that he met the former [princess Luciferna](/p/dc866b99f5794c99874dbaae8479870f) and engaged in idle conversation with her in the stoneyard of cell block D.

land is called Tartaros. [skeletons](/p/a83ed73098c5416684c4c5d4097e32dc), [demons](/p/a22030bec1ff40e587d2146fb95be185) , imps. vague 90s visions of hell. horned skull peoples,spooky ghosts, eye

important to be a comic spectacle

Music is forbidden in Tartarus. it attracts sinners, fallen angels, etc. their appearance indicates a higher world that they have degraded or given away. very powerful bosses. you win music by beating the fans of a track.

obscure and difficult to understand theology provide the world’s underpinnings

little spaceships travel fast. they’re all beaten up. (now [Starbus](/p/e91ff4dce0f8469b803a6d314663f59c) system)

if you crash, you’re marooned & have to go native against the indigenous until you can fix it yourself (maybe could be a level?)

certain areas in the midst of vast wildernesses become stages for great dramas and battles. huge battles happening sometimes that the PC isn’t involved in.

huge expansive landscape, mute protagonist

there was an insurrection, now only hell is left.

very high difficulty. not artificial

demigod drama:

Tiamat: chaos of primordial creation,

Apzu: name of the primeval ocean, a primeval freshwater god that meets with Tiamat

Groups:

Knights of Eden: A secretive cabal that scours the worlds in search of the reincarnated souls of Adam and Eve. They claim that they can sense if a soul is truly primal (original).

The Knights’ goal is apocatastasis: the return of the world to the state of innocence. They want to create a garden without the possibility of original sin. They are a secret splinter cell composed of high-ranking members of the Empire. As such, they are late level enemies. If the player wants to side with them, however, they’re powerful allies. They’re searching for Lucy, who they believe to be the reincarnation of Eve.

The Kingdom: The nameless sovereignty that controls the universe. Omniscient, omnipresent, omnipotent. The lion is the king.

Regicides:

Weapons:

AB101: Standard issue laser rifle. Semi-automatic, good for mid-range targets. Can be loaded with different types of ammunition.

Botany:

Gopherwood trees. These populate the forest around the Tartaro estate.

Prologue: The Shores of Hell

Sunset is making the ocean red.

He meets Sophia:

She has a sad expression on her face.

The player awakens in the prisoner processing station, in a line of prisoners.

NPC enemy types:

Princes of the Empire (bosses): About 12-30 of these guys. They look like revenants but dressed in dark robes and regal dress. They wield miniguns, and move extremely fast.

Imperial

Chapter 1: Tartaros

The main drive in the beginning comes in a dream.

It’s here, forced to hunt game (deer) & conduct pest control (snakes) for an imperial potentate with a gang of other slaves, that the player develops combat skills.

Prisoners pressed into higher hunting duty.

“If only they were as peaceful and as lovely as their maker."

Banipal: Director of the choir of heaven. The choir was massacred when it was discovered that they were performing old world songs in secret. One of John’s friends averted his death, but he carries an unshakable guilt. Teaches Lucy how to sing.

The player is trained by Lucy. “I’ve been here much longer than you have.”

The emperor rules from an infinite distance. Even the provincial potentate is never seen. Nobody ever enters of leaves the walls of the enormous, fortified estate in the forest.

Lucy talks to you to pass the time. Each time the player gets better at fighting, Lucy tells him some of her life story. These segments are playable, serving as an interlude from the fighting.

Lucy was a princess in an opulent land. On the night of her honeymoon, however, she tarried—stepping out into her balcony to thank her heraldic stars for the countless blessings that they had showered upon her.  In that moment, however, the imperial abductors fell on her, spiriting her away into a life of bondage. Her prince is still waiting for her to return: looking into the numberless stars. If she could only know that he had never stopped being faithful to their love… had never given up on his belief in their reunion.

PC eventually gets to look into her file. It’s curt: “born into slavery. orphan.”.

Eventually, messengers from the estate stop arriving, along with rations. Slaves get listless and begin to eat snakes. Rumors spread of a slave revolution across the empire. The slaves eventually work up the courage to break into the compound. Beside a few inconsequential documents, it’s empty—as if its owners had abandoned it in the dead of night.

The slaves steal some transport trucks from the owners and, examining the maps, find the way to the nearby starport. Maybe the player does this. On the way to the port, the players encounter a lot of vicious wildlife (as well as a hidden crashed vehicle with rare items inside)

When they arrive at the port, they find a deeply entrenched imperial security death squad (1 commander, 4 squadmates) waiting for them. The slaves have the advantage of numbers, however, and they overrun the imperial forces. Here the player gets to try on some destroyed imperial armor (10% as effective as the regular thing). The pest rifles work well against imperial soldiers.

Soldiers at the port aren’t proper soldiers, just colonial police. They wear cream colored gear with light armor.

Taking ships from the starport, the slaves scatter to to the four winds.

Where to go from here? Lucy has to be abducted by the lion. He carries her in his teeth, holding her by the collar of her jumpsuit. On the flagstones of the planetary capital, flanked by two pillars with burning sconces at the top of them.

The starship is only a light class one. To have greater travel capacity, the PC has to go to a less outlying starport and travel to a wide range one. Desert planet Mida.

Sniper wars while crossing the desert. Water shortages.

What does the PC want now?

Something about the body of a titan. kabbala. Each part of the body corresponds to a world. Completed in the form of a primal being; a just adjudicator

Major opponent is the bad star

The traveller

At the end, the lion binds himself to Lucy.

“A variant of the Wandering Jew legend is recorded in the [Flores Historiarum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flores_Historiarum) by [Roger of Wendover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_of_Wendover)around the year 1228.[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wandering_Jew#cite_note-12)[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wandering_Jew#cite_note-13)[\[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wandering_Jew#cite_note-14) An Armenian archbishop, then visiting England, was asked by the monks of [St Albans Abbey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Albans_Abbey) about the celebrated [Joseph of Arimathea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_of_Arimathea), who had spoken to Jesus, and was reported to be still alive. The archbishop answered that he had himself seen such a man in Armenia, and that his name was Cartaphilus, a Jewish shoemaker, who, when Jesus stopped for a second to rest while carrying his cross, hit him, and told him “Go on quicker, Jesus! Go on quicker! Why dost Thou loiter?”, to which Jesus, “with a stern countenance”, is said to have replied: “I shall stand and rest, but thou shalt go on till the last day.” The Armenian bishop also reported that Cartaphilus had since converted to Christianity and spent his wandering days [proselytizing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proselytize) and leading a [hermit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermit)’s life.”

“I’ll stay and rest, but you will wander till the end of time."

The world is almost empty.

In this style, but with cloaks, skull faces, crown, and miniguns (princes of the empire). Cloaks sweep behind them and light up when

they fire. Princes of the empire move fast, their cloaks flow behind them

(less cartoony, less comical, little more realistic, darker)
