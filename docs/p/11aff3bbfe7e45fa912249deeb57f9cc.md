Brief Commentary

This isn’t a gnostic story, despite the overtones. The [Lion](/p/2001b9b679ed4d8abbd8cfb46998773c) has more in common with the antichrist.

The idea of the [ghosts](/p/da622103663d4fad8372a8769414cc25) may seem unduly emanatory, but it’s only a figurative manner of speaking.

As for singing a new world into existence, that, again, is merely figurative…

It’s just a fairy tale… but it is all based on super advanced technology.
