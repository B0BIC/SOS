Tree System

1 skill tree for taking the messenger key, one tree for taking the warfighter key. Leave both keys and access both trees? (prerequisite for legendary mode?)

Angel skill tree based on motion, warfighter skill tree based on firepower.

Maybe a third tree, connected to the key to the end, that is unlocked once beating the game at the hardest difficulty…

Tree of the end… holds stealth bonuses. Unlocks invisibility
