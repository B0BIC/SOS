Type: Creature

Defunct AI program/sprite/pixie, maybe owned by [Lucy](/p/dc866b99f5794c99874dbaae8479870f) or somehow connected to her.

It’s a little light which flits around, casting a small light by itself but also has the ability to dwell in certain municipal / infrastructure lights and illuminate them. Can serve to lead the player through the environment or “gate” things until the time is right (as it can open doors which would otherwise be inoperable).

Never says anything. Just a dutiful servant of Lucy.

She can assign him to Sunset.

Maybe he acts like a little dog... barking energetically etc.

Backstory:

Was found in the distant reaches of the galaxy by the ancient messengers.

Surveyor gave him to Lucy.

**Powered by a Maxwell's demon.**

Zips around her. She tells him to do stuff.

How are they re-united? Does she smuggle him into prison?

Maybe you have to fight through [resource processing](/p/04e9737208bb49b3834df5c8cf687ab3) before you escape.

He was found by [the Surveyor](/p/c7964e9075b3441eb4bd789fd283aa6a), long ago, in the distant reaches of a remote galaxy. A creature containing an internal Maxwell's demon. Manipulates natural energy gradients to buzz around with power.
