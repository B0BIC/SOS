A system used on huge planets where you simply voyage through the massive world without boredom.

Similar to the same mechanic in Fallout 1 & 2, where you just travel on a giant map as time goes by.

But the difference here is that the whole world is modeled, and there are secrets/random encounters in the huge world.

[Random Encounters](/p/b4b2a46abf0b4e8286c273322df634e1)! That's a fun idea.

In Fallout 3 you can just run into your Dad. It's rare but it can happen...

Maybe in a similar way, you can encounter citizens, other ghosts... even the lion.

Maybe it is auto-initialized by a fade to black (once you reach the limits) and shift to a "Autorun" screen, but you can manually initialize it.

As a shadow, you never get hungry or tired... so you can effectively walk indefinitely. You can slow your conscious processes to the point where time appears to past in an instant.

But it helps to sleep when it is dark and the terrain cannot be easily navigated.

Without a [Map](/p/6826cdb4201e4207b39485730087cfc9), all you can do is set a heading and go straight for X hours or until the sunset...

See [Overworld Navigation](/p/5393352ec6b149979eed09491ebd075d).

Maybe it could even show the process. Like a fast motion walk, to signify that your thoughts are slowed. Or just nothing.
