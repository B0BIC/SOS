HappyMapCharacter type: Lost Soul

Very first tutorial guide for the player.

HappyMap: the one whom the surveyor loved, Happy Mapping AI. Its master moved on and left it behind. 

Apprentice & greatest companion of the great beloved universal architect. Insomniac. Floating emoji (planescape, halo, portal 2). Tech companion created by the primal people. Later PC discovers that she was designed a robot friend for lonely people. \
The golden, primal people were so advanced, however, that even a cheap product meant to help surveyors possesses free will and a conscience, and is capable of advanced abstract thought. \
the absence of the primal people leaves her unfulfilled. \
“I was made to love them. But they're gone. So I don't know what to do. Maybe I could help you. You're just an echo of what they were. But I can still help you. But I'm doing it for them, understand?"

Galactic surveyor AI. Necessary to establish links to other stars. \
