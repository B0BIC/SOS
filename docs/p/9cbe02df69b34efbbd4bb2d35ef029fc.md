Unknown.

The world has existed for a very long time. No one knows how long, or where it came from.

At some point the [Primevals](/p/2f7c73ff336643cfab6933e00eb6b40e) created a civilization. We do not even know what they looked like. They are gone now.

But we can infer from their echoes, from their shadows. From those things we can infer what they were.

The world was devastated by an **ancient disaster**.

The lion consolidated power and stabilized the world somewhat. But he has no interest in helping others or restoring the world to its ancient fulness. His own comfort and security is enough. But the shadows remind him of the past world. They torment him because they remind him of a world which has forever ceased to exist but they fascinate him because of the nagging sense that maybe there is some way back, after all.

The lion lost his memory in the disaster.

Full disclosure. There was a great event which made the world full of light and gave men energy. But when they betrayed this great light, it was worse than ever before.

Thus mankind had become so living that he could imbue insensate matter with a form of life.

But the goodness of the world was erased like never before. I speak, of course, of [MansBestFriend](/p/2e58a4c24f8e4bf2a6779f1fd191a209).

And the [Witnesses](/p/71f7bbe694b74dde9a39c628cfc1e9ff). Now whom have to remain in silence.
