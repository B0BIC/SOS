Lion’s purpose:

Maybe he wants to have Lucy because, as Sophia,[she can sing a new world into existence](/p/4f10d741d1b949dda6606a9af27b0225)? But he can’t, because she won’t sing for him…

Little bird, please sing for me…

She alone, as the echo of Sophia, has the power to sing a new world into existence.
