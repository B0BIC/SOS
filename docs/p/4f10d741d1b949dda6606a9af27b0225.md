Music Mechanics

Beautiful Score, deactivates forever if [Lucy](/p/dc866b99f5794c99874dbaae8479870f) dies.

**Only plays when you’re around Lucy**. Pleasant piano music, maybe symphonic. Gotta be good easy listening, not something you’d get sick of.

Each track only plays once! Or you can ask her to sing certain songs, maybe… once every few hours, or so.

There should be a [Music Book](:/b9f7f9fd2cff4e3d98a35c8c7e830278) for this purpose.

When she actually sings, new life springs into existence. Flowers renew themselves, things regain color, as if it was some celestial magic…

Created with OneNote.

***

Voice lines play once and have heavy synth filtering to make them whispered and 8 bit. Story mode vs gameplay mode.
