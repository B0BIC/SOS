Counterpart to [fear bar/courage system](/p/445e797334f84ea289ef2dd329a4c488).

Just as fear charges as you do damage, the courage system rolls up as they inflict more attacks on you, until Warfighters / others lock into “fury mode,” where they attack and move 10% faster (and no longer take cover but constantly attack). 

Eye color and callout lines change at this point.

They have different fury stats depending on difficulty and what makes sense.
