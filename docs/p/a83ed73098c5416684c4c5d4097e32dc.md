Black skeleton you meet in [the lonely](/p/2e52e2f53aea40569e46d4db26a5cb37).

A bit like tarman. Shuffles around almost like it's on wires. This strange jerky shamble. Like a puppet...

Always pursuing you.

A failed attempt by the [primal people](/p/2f7c73ff336643cfab6933e00eb6b40e) to create eternal life. Instead it is this deathless monster.

The exclusion of death is not the same as life.

He communicates all this to you... sighing, whispering. Lion tauntingly gives you the message when he drops you off on this planet. You may want to avoid... that one.

If he catches you and bites you, it's over.

You have the chance/choice to leave him be or mercy kill him.
