You are an echo/shadow, working in a [prison](/p/fde64cac01824d63a685fa2cd4695b38) in the hinterlands  of a dying **deep space civilization**…

Ok, so you’re working, chained together hunting snakes and the occasional [devil](/p/a22030bec1ff40e587d2146fb95be185) which pops up and scares you until the [warfighters](/p/64a95ac03b7546249ebe255b2b2fd8a6) gun it down…

At this point in the game, the player should always be saddled to a long (but finite) [chain](/p/b3a6916a9ea54f8a99922e39bafc8d13) which rattles behind them wherever they go, until it clinks at the limit (and you can go no further).

Cell rattles open (there are only about 10 cells in the complex) and the [prisoners](/p/49b73ae066e8462d9e228a65f4217581) shuffle out. They line up and each one takes a [laser rifle](/p/0d0a4b561997452aa1e2d4caa9aa5848). Cain gives a brief talk. Invites someone to shoot at him, if they dare. Someone does, his gun explodes, and his body stays on the chain for the rest of the game (some [witnesses](/p/e297d82e5afd4b319a71ebe05308aeeb) try to bury him, and player can use Cain’s key to free him, if he wants).

At some point, the [princess](/p/dc866b99f5794c99874dbaae8479870f) talks to the player (through a crack in the cell wall, like Pyramus and Thisbe)…
