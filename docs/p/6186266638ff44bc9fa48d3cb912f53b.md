An activation is a higher aspect of a [shadow/ghost/echo](/p/da622103663d4fad8372a8769414cc25).

Sunset’s is **Nightfall**.

Lucy’s is **Sophia**.

Activation functions like deja vu. Triggered by memories. If you are in a situation which reminds you of the past…

So Nightfall and Sophia, when they first have a moment of freedom… this is a moment of activation.

When they look into each other's eyes. They recall their internal nature.

It is caused by interconscious recognition. It can also happen with the [witnesses](/p/71f7bbe694b74dde9a39c628cfc1e9ff) as well. Looking at [Charon and Snowball](/p/e297d82e5afd4b319a71ebe05308aeeb) could take you to little bonus levels.

The activations have full knowledge of their conditions.

This activation is what causes an energy flare which wakes lion up. Maybe not even necessary. Actually maybe it’s not his remembering.

He remembers and simultaneously (almost) there is an energy flare caused by Sunset and Lucy’s **mutual recognition.**

This causes him to pursue them and follow them to [the Library](/p/2027d68ffecb47449da8062236a6f303)
