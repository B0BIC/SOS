There are two types of summary.

**Top-down**, and **player perspective**. We can think of these as theÂ **objective** and **subjective** summaries.

**Objective:**

The world was destroyed by a catastrophe. Only fragments remain. The lion knows that these shards are keys to the immense technological ability of the primevals.

**Subjective:**

You are a prisoner. You know someone who wants to go home. So you go with her. It's your only chance at getting out.
