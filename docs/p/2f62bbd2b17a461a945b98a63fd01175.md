## **Intro Scene:**

You arrive at the limits of the [Outer City](/p/092136e62d3346eb8eac716f912b06c2) and encounter a vast labyrinth of city streets.

What could inspire the player to get near one of these things?

Maybe there’s some writing on the pediment. I can imagine you brushing the dust away. Then you notice Liberty stirring.

When you first enter the city, you meet [Liberty](/p/f92b3507b1bf46cc81c6c04fb40efa41) on a pediment. But next to her there is an empty pediment, marked ["Justice"](/p/fe6019bf0f1f40eb990fb3fc1da2494f)

Instead of pitching down from a high pitched shriek (as in the case of [The Weatherman](/p/626c245aa9f84338bbd35a3874186b8a)), Liberty’s voice rises up as the coalescence of whispers.

Maybe a bunch of phones ringing.

A ton of phones ringing, then a bunch of “Hello?” Like she’s playing recordings of people saying “Hello?” when they pick up their phone.

(I really like this scene)
