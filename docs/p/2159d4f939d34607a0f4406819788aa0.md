Icon is displayed when something happens which could have gone differently or when the player is faced with a choice.

So there are at least three:

1\. "Crossroads" symbol

2\. Choice A

3\. Choice B

They change color based on the rarity of a choice.Â 

This will help development because often developers add a bunch of content which almost no player will ever see. This can be cool, but the player at least needs to know how to access it.
