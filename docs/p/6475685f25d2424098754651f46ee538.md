New Game + (legend mode, irony mode, silence)

The first new game + sets the game in “funnymode,” whole new lines of dialogue mocking the last game, treating it as a given. Maybe this game could be an ironic legendary retelling…

Game Dialogue 1: How it really happened

Game Dialogue 2: Legendary Story of it, how it’s retold by people in the distant future.

Game Dialogue 3: Ironic retelling, it’s already established into culture
