Object Permanence \[Tech]

This is a huge part of the game.

All bullet casings, bulletholes, **footprints**, & **dead bodies** MUST be preserved, even at the cost of other resources (i.e: turn down the graphics if you have to in order to achieve this).

This is actually crucial to the plot. The [Lion](/p/2001b9b679ed4d8abbd8cfb46998773c) is pursued by his footprints.

Benefits: limits the amount of infinite respawns devs can foist on the player.

Possible exception: [Witnesses](/p/71f7bbe694b74dde9a39c628cfc1e9ff) (namely, [Charon and Snowball](/p/e297d82e5afd4b319a71ebe05308aeeb)) can clean bodies (pick them up and carry them to [The Grave Zone](/p/8c61516daa304a7da75a31432d1c6e04)), but this has to be a real process. If anything, it's more resource intensive than the person.

[Charon and Snowball](/p/e297d82e5afd4b319a71ebe05308aeeb) travel quickly when they’re not in range of Sunset.

But time seems to shift when they get near him, and they remark on this in some miscellaneous dialogue...

**Fully destructible environments.** But they’re all ruins anyway. So ruins just crumbling further.

Enemies have to climb over fallen enemies, huge piles boost their [fear bar](/p/445e797334f84ea289ef2dd329a4c488)

Fallen [Warfighters ](/p/64a95ac03b7546249ebe255b2b2fd8a6) are also retrieved/repaired by [Salvage Team](/p/9dc015ab7b754160a21e447e30a80c20).
